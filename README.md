<br />1)Home Page <br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp;  a)Search any movie from the API and display the search results on the frontend (as I type the search results should update, just like Google does for suggestions).
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; b)Each search result of the movie should have a favourite button, clicking on which the movie should be added to “My favourite movies” (a list).
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; c)On clicking any particular search result (any movie), open a new page with more information about that movie (movie page)

<br />2)Movie Page
<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; a)Should show information about the movie like its name, photo, plot, etc (these are must, rest you can add if you want).

<br />3)My favourite movies Page

<br />  &nbsp; &nbsp; b)Make this list persistent (should have the same number of movies before and after closing the browser/refreshing the browser).
